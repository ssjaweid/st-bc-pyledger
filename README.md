# st-bc-pyledger

## Description
This program is used to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface using streamlit. 
This ledger will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Other details
We validate the application by running it on local host:
